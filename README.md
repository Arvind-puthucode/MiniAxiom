# Motivation
I'm interested in understanding how formal proof engines like Coq work, and how large language models (LLMs) can be used to translate natural language queries into formal representations that such systems can process.

This project is inspired by the work of Symbolica and George Morgan, with the long-term goal of grasping and contributing to the kind of reasoning systems they’re building.

# MathGraph: Hybrid Mathematical Reasoning System

A novel hybrid approach to mathematical problem solving that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with formal reasoning engines to achieve both natural language understanding and mathematical rigor.

## 🎯 Core Innovation

**Hybrid Architecture**: LLMs handle the ambiguous natural language ↔ formal representation mapping, while deterministic algorithms ensure mathematical rigor and correctness in the reasoning process.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

## 🔬 Mathematical Foundations

### Formal Language

The system uses a restricted formal language with these predicates:

- **Equality & Comparison**: `eq`, `gt`, `lt`, `gte`, `lte`
- **Number Properties**: `even`, `odd`, `prime`, `positive`, `negative`
- **Arithmetic Relations**: `divides`, `multiple`

### Inference Rules

Sample rules implemented:

```
R1: eq(X + A, B) → eq(X, B - A)           [Subtraction Property]
R2: eq(A * X, B) → eq(X, B / A)           [Division Property]
R3: eq(X, Y) ∧ eq(Y, Z) → eq(X, Z)        [Transitivity]
R4: even(X) → even(X * Y)                 [Even Multiplication]
R5: gt(X, Y) ∧ gt(Y, Z) → gt(X, Z)        [Greater Than Transitivity]
```

## 🎯 Demo Results
